# Modules

Per-module purpose, entities, workflow and state rules, permissions and audit events (CLAUDE.md §54). The exact route list with permissions is generated in [`api-routes.md`](api-routes.md). Business rules live in `apps/api/src/modules/<module>/*.service.ts`; PostgreSQL enforces the hard invariants again in `packages/database/prisma/migrations`.

## Platform (`apps/api/src/common`, `modules/auth|tenants|facilities|users|settings|numbering|audit`)
| Concern | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Tenant context | Taken only from the authenticated session; `AuthGuard` re-reads user, tenant, facility and permissions from the database on every request. |
| Auth | tenant code + username/email + password; scrypt hashes; 15-minute access JWT; opaque rotating refresh tokens (reuse revokes the family); lockout after repeated failures; per-route rate limits. |
| Permissions | `packages/shared/src/permissions.ts` (single source). Roles are bundles of permissions; custom roles supported. |
| Idempotency | `Idempotency-Key` mandatory on payments, refunds, credit notes, dispensing, purchases, stock adjustments; optional on patient create, walk-in, admit. A reused key with a different body is rejected (422). |
| Numbering | Concurrency-safe counters per tenant/facility (MRN, visit, admission, invoice, receipt, prescription, dispense…). |
| Settings | Per-facility, validated by a key registry; feature flags; print header/footer; discharge rules. Changes audited. |
| Errors | Stable codes, no stack traces, request id in every error and log line. |

## Clinical front desk
| Module | Entities and rules | Key permissions | Audit events |
|---|---|---|---|
| Patients | One canonical patient; MRN as identifier; trigram duplicate detection (never auto-merge); optimistic `version` on update; override needs `DUPLICATE_OVERRIDE` and is audited | PATIENT_READ/CREATE/UPDATE, DUPLICATE_OVERRIDE | PATIENT_CREATED, PATIENT_UPDATED, PATIENT_DUPLICATE_OVERRIDDEN |
| Appointments | Practitioner schedules, slot availability; exclusion constraints prevent double booking; walk-in; overbooking needs APPOINTMENT_OVERBOOK | APPOINTMENT_* | APPOINTMENT_CREATED/RESCHEDULED/CANCELLED/CHECKED_IN/NO_SHOW |
| OPD queue | Token per day per doctor; `call-next` uses `SKIP LOCKED`; completion blocked while the consultation is a draft; priority/emergency | QUEUE_READ/MANAGE | QUEUE_CALL, QUEUE_START… , QUEUE_PRIORITY_CHANGED |
| Encounters, vitals | Every clinical record references an encounter; vitals are append-only with enter-in-error | VITALS_READ/CREATE | ENCOUNTER_OPENED, VITALS_RECORDED, VITALS_ENTERED_IN_ERROR |

## Clinical records
| Module | Rules | Permissions | Audit events |
|---|---|---|---|
| Consultation | DRAFT → SIGNED → AMENDED; signed content is never overwritten; amendment keeps every version with reason and actor | CONSULTATION_READ/CREATE/SIGN/AMEND | CONSULTATION_STARTED/SIGNED/AMENDED, DIAGNOSIS_RECORDED/REMOVED |
| Allergies | Recorded with severity; status changes keep history; matched against every prescription and dispense (acknowledgement is audited) | ALLERGY_WRITE | ALLERGY_RECORDED, ALLERGY_STATUS_CHANGED, *_ALLERGY_ACKNOWLEDGED |
| Prescriptions | One draft per encounter; signed with the consultation (OPD) or on its own (IPD orders); amendments supersede; stopping an item keeps the original | PRESCRIPTION_READ/CREATE/SIGN | PRESCRIPTION_DRAFT_SAVED/SIGNED/SUPERSEDED, PRESCRIPTION_ITEM_STOPPED |

## Money
| Module | Rules | Permissions | Audit events |
|---|---|---|---|
| Billing | Draft invoices are editable; issued invoices never change (credit note, refund or cancel instead); totals computed server-side with decimal maths; split payments; overpayment rejected; deferred DB checks reconcile invoice totals to receipts, refunds and credit notes | INVOICE_*, PAYMENT_CREATE/REFUND, INVOICE_ADJUST | INVOICE_CREATED/ISSUED/CANCELLED, PAYMENT_RECEIVED, REFUND_CREATED, CREDIT_NOTE_CREATED, INVOICE_DISCOUNT_APPLIED |
| Cashier shifts | One open shift per cashier; cash needs an open shift; expected vs counted cash on close | CASHIER_SHIFT_MANAGE | SHIFT_OPENED/CLOSED |
| Pharmacy | Medicine master; batches with expiry; stock ledger is the source of truth and the balance is reconciled to it by the database; FEFO allocation under row locks; no expired or blocked batch is dispensed; returns restore stock | PHARMACY_READ/DISPENSE/PURCHASE/ADJUST_STOCK/MASTERS | PHARMACY_DISPENSED/RETURN, STOCK_OPENING_RECORDED, STOCK_ADJUSTED, PURCHASE_RECEIVED/RETURNED, MEDICINE_* |

## Inpatient
| Module | Rules | Permissions | Audit events |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beds and admissions | Ward → room → bed; one active admission per patient; one open bed assignment per admission; a bed is occupied by at most one admission; transfers keep the full bed history; admissions are closed (read-only) after discharge | ADMISSION_READ/CREATE/TRANSFER | ADMISSION_CREATED/CANCELLED, BED_TRANSFERRED, BED_STATUS_CHANGED |
| IPD charges | Pending → billed/voided; bed days accrue per assignment | CHARGE_CREATE (free-price lines need billing rights) | CHARGE_POSTED/VOIDED, BED_CHARGES_POSTED |
| Nursing and MAR | Notes with addenda; tasks; medication schedule generated from signed orders; GIVEN/MISSED/HELD/REFUSED recorded separately from the order; intake/output with enter-in-error | NURSING_READ/DOCUMENT/MEDICATION_ADMINISTER | NURSING_NOTE_*, NURSING_TASK_CREATED, MAR_SCHEDULE_GENERATED, MEDICATION_GIVEN, INTAKE_OUTPUT_* |
| Discharge | Doctor marks fit first; configurable clearance steps; waiver needs a reason; final bill from pending charges; summary signed by the treating consultant; completion releases the bed and closes the encounter; cannot complete with an unpaid final bill | ADMISSION_DISCHARGE (+ step permissions) | DISCHARGE_STEP_CLEARED/WAIVED, FINAL_INVOICE_CREATED, DISCHARGE_SUMMARY_*, ADMISSION_DISCHARGED |

## Documents
| Module | Rules | Permissions | Audit events |
|---|---|---|---|
| Patient files | Photo (one active) and scanned documents; PNG/JPEG/PDF only, content-checked, ≤ 5 MB; bytes on disk (S3 later), metadata in PostgreSQL; removal hides the file but keeps it and its history; the database forbids edits and deletes | PATIENT_READ (view), PATIENT_UPDATE (upload, remove) | PATIENT_FILE_UPLOADED, PATIENT_FILE_VIEWED (documents), PATIENT_FILE_REMOVED |

## Read side
| Module | Notes |
|---|---|
| Print | Server-rendered, fully escaped HTML or PDF (`?format=pdf`) for invoice, receipt, prescription, discharge summary and patient label, from one document model; locked-down CSP; reprints are stamped "DUPLICATE COPY"; every print is audited (`DOCUMENT_PRINTED`, with its format). |
| Reports | 13 bounded operational reports (date ranges ≤ 93 days, facility-scoped, `REPORT_READ`). |
| Audit viewer | Read-only list with filters; the table is append-only at the database level. |
